#####  This Omdena Local Chapter Challenge runs for 4 weeks.  This project is initiated by the Warsaw, Poland Chapter to solve Real World Problems.

### The Problem
 Air pollution is a major problem in Poland which has the worst air quality among the countries in Europe.
 The annual EEA reports on air quality show that Poland is among the countries with the worst air quality in Europe. 
 Bad air quality affects peopleâ€™s lives and constitutes a considerable health risk.
 Mitigating air pollution could improve quality of life and lead to an overall healthier society
 At the same time, this would reduce costs for the Polish health care system.
 
 An important step towards mitigation is the identification of the main factors and causes of air pollution specific to Poland. 
 By using local time-series data on air pollutants together with other relevant country-specific data, an AI-assisted approach could yield valuable insights in this matter. 
 In particular, a machine-learning model for air quality prediction could give policy makers a simple but powerful tool to help tackle the issue of air pollution in Poland.

### How could AI help?
+ A statistical model based on machine learning could yield valuable insights into main factors and causes of air pollution specific to Poland
    â†’ important step towards mitigation of air pollution
+ A machine-learning model for air quality prediction can give policy makers a simple but powerful tool to help tackle the issue of air pollution in Poland.
+ We will focus on the Common Air Quality Index (CAQI):

### The Goals
The goals of this project are: 
+ Identification of main factors contributing to air pollution in Poland.
+ Prototype a simple machine-learning model to predict air quality:
    - Classification or Regression model
    - Conventional or Deep learning model).
+ Open source GitHub repository.
